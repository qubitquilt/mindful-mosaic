## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of Mindful Mosaic up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v10.x or later)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qubitquilt/mindful-mosaic.git
cd mindful-mosaic
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This is a monorepo using npm workspaces. Install all dependencies from the root directory.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

The application requires a set of environment variables to run. Copy the example from `packages/db/.env` to a new `.env` file in the root of the project.

```bash
cp packages/db/.env .env
```

Open the new `.env` file and add your credentials for authentication. You will need to create OAuth credentials from a provider like Google or GitHub.

```dotenv
# .env

# Database URL (defaults to a local SQLite file)
DATABASE_URL="file:./packages/db/prisma/dev.db"

# NextAuth.js Credentials
# Generate a secret: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Example for Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations

Apply the database schema to your local SQLite database.

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

This will also generate the Prisma Client, making it available to the application.

### 5. Run the Development Server

The web application is a Next.js project located in `apps/web`.

```bash
# Navigate to the web app directory
cd apps/web

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
