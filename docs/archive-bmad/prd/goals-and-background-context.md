# **Goals and Background Context**

**Goals**

* To create a viable, community-driven, open-source alternative to proprietary routine planners.
* To empower users with digital sovereignty over their organizational system through self-hosting and full data control.
* To build a platform that champions the principles of privacy, user control, and open access.
* To foster a healthy and engaged community that helps guide the project's growth and evolution.

**Background Context**

Technically proficient individuals, especially those with organizational challenges, currently face a compromise: either use costly, proprietary tools that sacrifice privacy and control, or rely on less effective solutions. Existing market leaders create vendor lock-in, offer no self-hosting options, and restrict user choice in areas like AI integration. This project addresses this gap by creating a powerful, open-source, and self-hostable platform that provides a feature-rich experience without compromising on user freedom or data privacy.
