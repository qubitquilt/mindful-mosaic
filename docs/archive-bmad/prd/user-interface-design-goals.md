# **User Interface Design Goals**

Overall UX Vision

The UX vision is a hybrid, combining the holistic visual planning of "Structured" with the guided, focused execution of "Routinery." The user will start with a clear, comprehensive timeline of their day, which provides clarity and reduces planning friction. When a routine begins, the interface will transition into a minimalist, single-task focus mode, reducing distractions and decision fatigue during execution. The core principle is: Plan your day, then execute your plan.

Key Interaction Paradigms

The application will operate in two primary modes:

1. **Planning Mode (Timeline View):** Inspired by Structured, this is the main dashboard. It will feature a clean, vertical timeline of the user's day, integrating their routines and tasks. The key interaction will be flexible, allowing users to easily drag-and-drop to reschedule and reorganize their day.
2. **Execution Mode (Focus View):** When a user starts a routine, the UI will shift to a minimalist, Routinery-inspired timer view. This mode will display only the current task, a visual timer, and simple controls (e.g., pause, skip to next). This is designed to eliminate distractions and guide the user through their routine one step at a time.

Core Screens and Views

The MVP will require the following core screens:

* **Sign-In Screen:** A simple page with SSO provider buttons.
* **Daily Timeline / Dashboard:** The main "Planning Mode" view.
* **Routine Editor:** A view to create, edit, and schedule a routine and its associated tasks.
* **Active Routine View:** The "Execution Mode" screen, featuring the current task and timer.
* **Settings:** A basic page for managing account settings (e.g., Sign Out).

**Accessibility**

* **Standard:** The application will aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

**Branding**

* **Approach:** The design will be minimalist and clean, using a neutral color palette to support a focused and calm user experience.

**Target Device and Platforms**

* **Platform:** Web Responsive, designed with a mobile-first approach.
