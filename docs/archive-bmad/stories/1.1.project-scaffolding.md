# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Setup

## Status
- [ ] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the monorepo with the Next.js application and the job server placeholder,
**so that** I have a clean, consistent foundation for all future development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is initialized.
2. A Next.js application is created within the monorepo.
3. A placeholder directory for the future job server is created.
4. Prisma is initialized and configured to use an SQLite database for development.
5. A basic "Hello World" page is accessible when running the Next.js app.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Initialize Monorepo (AC: 1)**
  - [ ] Initialize an npm project in the root directory.
  - [ ] Create a `packages` directory for shared code.
  - [ ] Create an `apps` directory for the web and jobs services.
- [ ] **Task 2: Create Next.js Application (AC: 2)**
  - [ ] Use `create-next-app` to scaffold a new Next.js project in `apps/web`.
  - [ ] Configure the Next.js application to work within the monorepo structure.
- [ ] **Task 3: Create Job Server Placeholder (AC: 3)**
  - [ ] Create a new directory `apps/jobs`.
  - [ ] Add a placeholder `package.json` and `index.ts` file.
- [ ] **Task 4: Initialize Prisma (AC: 4)**
  - [ ] Add Prisma as a dependency to a shared `packages/db` package.
  - [ ] Run `prisma init` to create the initial schema and configuration.
  - [ ] Update `schema.prisma` to use the SQLite provider.
- [ ] **Task 5: Create "Hello World" Page (AC: 5)**
  - [ ] Create a simple page in the Next.js app that displays "Hello World".
  - [ ] Ensure the page is accessible when running the development server.
