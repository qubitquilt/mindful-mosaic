# Story 1.3: Core Application Layout & Navigation

## Status
- [x] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Review
- [x] Done

## Story
**As a** signed-in user,
**I want** to see the main application shell with a clear navigation bar and a sign-out option,
**so that** I can orient myself and securely end my session.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A main application layout is created that includes a persistent header or sidebar.
2. The navigation contains a "Sign Out" button for authenticated users.
3. Clicking "Sign Out" successfully logs the user out and redirects them to the sign-in page.
4. The user's identity (e.g., name or email) is visible somewhere in the layout.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Main Application Layout (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Modify `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` to include a persistent header component.
  - [x] Style the layout using Tailwind CSS to create a clean header and main content area. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Navigation Bar (AC: 2, 4)**
  - [x] Create a new `Header.tsx` component in `apps/web/src/components/layout/`.
  - [x] The header should display the application's name or logo.
  - [x] Fetch the user's session data using the `useSession` hook from `next-auth/react`. [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-architecture.md]
  - [x] Display the user's name or email in the header.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Sign-Out Functionality (AC: 2, 3)**
  - [x] Create a `SignOutButton.tsx` component in `apps/web/src/components/auth/`.
  - [x] The button should call the `signOut` function from `next-auth/react` when clicked.
  - [x] Add the `SignOutButton` to the `Header.tsx` component, visible only when a user is authenticated.

## Dev Notes
This story focuses on creating the primary user interface shell that will contain the rest of the application's features.

**Previous Story Insights:**
* Story 1.2 established the NextAuth.js setup. The `useSession` hook is now available on the client side to get user data.

**Tech Stack:**
* **Styling:** All components must be styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
* **Authentication:** Session data will be managed by NextAuth.js. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Component Specifications:**
* **`Header.tsx`**: A client-side component responsible for displaying top-level navigation and user session information.
* **`SignOutButton.tsx`**: A simple client-side component that triggers the sign-out flow.

**File Locations:**
* **Main Layout:** `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-architecture.md]
* **Header Component:** `apps/web/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
* **Auth Components:** `apps/web/src/components/auth/SignOutButton.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
