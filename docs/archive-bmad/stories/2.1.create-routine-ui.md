# Story 2.1: Create Routine UI

## Status
- [x] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Review
- [x] Done

## Story
**As a** signed-in user,
**I want** a clear button and form to start creating a new routine,
**so that** I can begin organizing my tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Create Routine" button is visible on the main timeline view (above Timeline component).
2. Clicking opens a modal form for routine name and tasks.
3. Form fields: Routine Name (text input), Add Task button to append task fields (name, duration in minutes).
4. Support adding/removing multiple tasks dynamically.
5. "Save Routine" button validates fields (name required, tasks at least 1) and submits.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Add Create Routine button to layout (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update Header.tsx to include button with onClick to open modal.
- [x] Task 2: Create routine form modal (AC: 2-4)
  - [x] Create RoutineForm.tsx with modal, inputs for name, dynamic task list.
  - [x] Implement add/remove task functionality with state.
- [x] Task 3: Form validation and save (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add validation logic; on save, call routine creation API (placeholder).

## Dev Notes
Integrate with existing auth (useSession from Epic 1).
Use Tailwind for styling, matching Timeline.
Modal: Use Radix or simple div with overlay.

### Testing
[x] Unit tests for form rendering/validation implemented in RoutineForm.test.tsx.
[x] Integration tests for button/modal open in Header.test.tsx.
E2e in Story 2.2.
