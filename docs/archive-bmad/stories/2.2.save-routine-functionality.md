# Story 2.2: Save Routine Functionality

## Status
- [x] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Review
- [x] Done

## Story
**As a** signed-in user,
**I want** to save a new routine I've created,
**so that** it is stored in my account for future use.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. "Save Routine" sends routine (name, tasks array with name/duration) to backend API.
2. Backend validates data (user auth, name non-empty, tasks valid).
3. Save to database (routines table with user_id FK, tasks sub-table).
4. Success: Close modal, show toast, refresh timeline.
5. Error: Display message for validation/network issues.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: API endpoint for routine creation (AC: 1-2)
  - [x] Create POST /api/routines/route.ts with auth, validation, Prisma save.
- [x] Task 2: Frontend form submission (AC: 3-5)
  - [x] In RoutineForm.tsx, use fetch to POST data on save.
  - [x] Handle success/error, integrate with session.

## Dev Notes
Use Prisma from packages/db for DB (add routine/task models if needed).
Auth: Require signed-in (from Epic 1).
Error handling: Use toast from UI library.

### Testing
Unit for API validation; integration for form submit/DB save; e2e for full flow.

### Completion Notes List
- Added Routine and Task models to Prisma schema and migrated.
- Created POST /api/routines/route.ts with auth using NextAuth, validation, and Prisma create with nested tasks.
- Updated RoutineForm.tsx to use useSession, fetch to API, handle auth/errors, alert on success.
- Updated Header.tsx to remove onSave prop.
- Extended NextAuth types for user.id.
- Updated RoutineForm.test.tsx with mocks for useSession and fetch.
