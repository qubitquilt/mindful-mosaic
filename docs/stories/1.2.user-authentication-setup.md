# Story 1.2: User Authentication Setup

## Status
- [x] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Review
- [x] Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to sign up or sign in using a social provider (e.g., Google or GitHub),
**so that** I can securely access my personal account.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. NextAuth.js is installed and configured in the Next.js application.
2. At least one social SSO provider (e.g., Google) is configured and functional.
3. A "Sign In" button is visible to unauthenticated users.
4. Clicking "Sign In" initiates the SSO authentication flow.
5. Upon successful authentication, a new user record is created in the database.
6. The user is redirected to the main dashboard after a successful login.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Install and Configure NextAuth.js (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Install `next-auth` and the Prisma adapter: `npm install next-auth @auth/prisma-adapter`.
  - [x] Create the dynamic API route at `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`.
  - [x] Configure NextAuth.js with the Prisma adapter and at least one OAuth provider (e.g., Google).
- [x] **Task 2: Update Prisma Schema (AC: 5)**
  - [x] Add the `Account`, `Session`, `User`, and `VerificationToken` models to the `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` file as required by NextAuth.js.
  - [x] Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name "add-auth-models"` to apply the changes to the database.
- [x] **Task 3: Create Sign-In UI (AC: 3, 4)**
  - [x] Create a `SignInButton` component that displays "Sign In" for unauthenticated users.
  - [x] Implement the `signIn()` method from `next-auth/react` to trigger the SSO flow on button click.
  - [x] Add the `SignInButton` to the main page (`apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`).
- [x] **Task 4: Handle User Redirection (AC: 6)**
  - [x] Ensure that after a successful login, the user is redirected from the provider's auth page back to the application's dashboard.

## Dev Notes
This story builds directly on the scaffolding from Story 1.1. The primary focus is to integrate NextAuth.js for handling social sign-on.

**Previous Story Insights:**
* The monorepo is set up with npm workspaces. All package installations should be handled from the root.
* Prisma is configured with an SQLite database.

**Tech Stack:**
* **NextAuth.js:** ~5.0.0 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
* **Prisma Adapter:** `@auth/prisma-adapter` will be used to connect NextAuth.js to the database.

**Database Schema:**
* The `User`, `Account`, `Session`, and `VerificationToken` models in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` must be updated to match the schema required by NextAuth.js. This includes adding fields for providers, tokens, and sessions. [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]

**Security:**
* All secrets, including `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and OAuth provider client IDs/secrets, must be managed via environment variables (`.env` file). Do not commit these to version control. [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
* The `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable must be set to `http://localhost:3000` for local development.

**File Locations:**
* The core NextAuth.js configuration will be in a new file at `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing
* No specific testing requirements for this story, as the testing framework is not yet set up.

### Review Date: 2025-09-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is clean, well-structured, and adheres to the documented architecture and coding standards. The use of NextAuth.js and the Prisma adapter is correctly implemented.

### Refactoring Performed
None. The code quality was sufficient and did not require immediate refactoring.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✗ (No tests were included as part of this story.)
- All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Add a new story to Epic 1 (e.g., Story 1.5) to implement a testing framework (Jest and React Testing Library) as defined in the architecture.
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Add tests for the `SignInButton` component to verify its rendering and functionality in both signed-in and signed-out states.
- [ ] Add a basic integration test to verify the NextAuth.js API route is functioning correctly.

### Security Review
The implementation correctly uses environment variables for all secrets, and the NextAuth.js configuration follows security best practices. No vulnerabilities were identified.
