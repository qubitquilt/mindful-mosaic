# Story 1.4: Daily Timeline View

## Status
- [x] Draft
- [x] Approved
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Review
- [x] Done

## Story
**As a** signed-in user,
**I want** to see a clean, empty daily timeline view as my main dashboard,
**so that** I have a clear space to begin planning my day.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main dashboard page displays a vertical, chronological timeline for the current day.
2. The timeline view correctly displays time slots (e.g., hourly blocks from morning to night).
3. The view is responsive and functions correctly on both mobile and desktop screen sizes.
4. Initially, the timeline is empty, with a message like "No routines scheduled for today."

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Update Main Dashboard Page (AC: 1, 4)**
  - [x] Modify `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` to render the timeline component within the existing layout.
  - [x] Add the empty state message "No routines scheduled for today." in the center of the timeline.
- [x] **Task 2: Create Timeline Component (AC: 1, 2)**
  - [x] Create a new `Timeline.tsx` component in `apps/web/src/components/`.
  - [x] Implement a vertical list of hourly time slots from 6 AM to 10 PM (16 slots).
  - [x] Each slot should display the time (e.g., "6:00 AM - 7:00 AM") and be empty initially.
- [x] **Task 3: Style Timeline with Tailwind (AC: 2, 3)**
  - [x] Apply Tailwind classes for vertical layout, spacing, and clean design (e.g., flex-col, p-4, border for slots).
  - [x] Ensure responsiveness using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., md:flex-row for adjustments if needed, but keep vertical).
- [x] **Task 4: Integrate and Verify Responsiveness (AC: 3)**
  - [x] Wrap the timeline in the Providers and ensure it renders under the Header.
  - [x] Test on different screen sizes (mobile/desktop) by checking rendered output.

## Dev Notes
This story builds on the core layout from 1.3, focusing on the main dashboard as an empty timeline for future routine planning.

**Previous Story Insights:**
- The application layout includes a persistent Header with user info and Sign Out. Use `useSession` for auth checks if needed, but since dashboard is post-auth, assume session exists. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.core-application-layout-navigation.md#Dev Agent Record]
- Providers component handles session and other contexts; ensure it's wrapped around the page content. Fixed React errors in previous by proper provider setup. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.core-application-layout-navigation.md#Completion Notes]

**Data Models:**
No specific data models for this story, as the timeline is empty and no database interactions are required yet. [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

**API Specifications:**
No API endpoints needed for this story, as it's a static empty view. [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

**Component Specifications:**
- **Timeline.tsx**: A client-side React component rendering a vertical list of time slots. Use divs with Tailwind for slots. Props: none initially. [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs; infer from tech-stack React usage]
- Integrate into page.tsx, ensuring it fits within the main content area below Header. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Key Directories]

**File Locations:**
- **Main Dashboard Page:** `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (modify to include Timeline). [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#apps/web]
- **Timeline Component:** `apps/web/src/components/Timeline.tsx` (create new). [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#apps/web/src/components/]

**Testing Requirements:**
No specific testing requirements for this story, as the testing framework (Jest/React Testing Library) is not yet implemented for UI components in this early phase. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing; No specific guidance found in architecture docs for testing-strategy]

**Technical Constraints:**
- Use Tailwind CSS utilities for all styling; avoid custom CSS. Ensure responsive design with Tailwind's built-in classes (e.g., sm:, md: prefixes). [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Styling Strategy; docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Styling]
- Next.js App Router: Page must be a server/client component as needed; use 'use client' if interactive. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Framework]
- Performance: Keep initial render lightweight since empty. [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

### Testing
No specific testing standards apply yet. Defer unit tests for Timeline component until testing setup in later stories. Manually verify responsiveness and empty state in browser.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
openrouter/sonoma-dusk-alpha

### Debug Log References
*No debug logs for this story.*

### Completion Notes List
*   Created Timeline component with 16 hourly slots from 6 AM to 10 PM.
*   Implemented empty state message "No routines scheduled for today." and empty slots with "Empty slot" placeholder.
*   Applied Tailwind CSS for vertical layout, responsive design, and clean styling.
*   Integrated Timeline into the main dashboard page.tsx within the existing layout and Providers.
*   Verified responsiveness: vertical layout works on mobile and desktop; max-width centering ensures good display.

### File List
*   `apps/web/src/components/Timeline.tsx` (created)
*   `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (modified)
