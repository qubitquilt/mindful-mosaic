# Story 2.3: Display Routines on Timeline

## Status
- [ ] Draft
- [ ] Approved
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

## Story
**As a** signed-in user,
**I want** to see my saved routines displayed on my daily timeline,
**so that** I can get a visual overview of my plan.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Timeline loads fetches user's routines for current day from API.
2. Routines render as blocks on Timeline at scheduled times (assume default start time).
3. Block shows routine name and total duration.
4. Click block expands to show task list.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: API for routine fetch (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create GET /api/routines/route.ts with user filter, date param.
- [ ] Task 2: Update Timeline to display routines (AC: 2-4)
  - [ ] In Timeline.tsx, fetch routines on load, render as slot blocks.
  - [ ] Add expand/collapse for task list.

## Dev Notes
Build on Timeline from Epic 1 (16 slots).
Assume routines have start time; default to morning if not.
Fetch on mount with useEffect.

### Testing
Unit for block rendering; integration for fetch/display.
