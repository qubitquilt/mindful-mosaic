- [x] In Progress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

## Story
**As a** signed-in user,
**I want** to be able to edit or delete a routine I've created,
**so that** I can adjust my plans as they change.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Edit/Delete buttons on routine block or detail view.
2. Edit opens pre-filled form, saves updates to API/DB.
3. Delete prompts confirmation, removes from DB on confirm.
4. Refresh timeline after edit/delete.
5. Error handling for API failures.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: API for edit/delete (AC: 1-3)
  - [ ] PUT /api/routines/[id]/route.ts for update.
  - [ ] DELETE /api/routines/[id]/route.ts for delete.
- [ ] Task 2: UI for edit/delete (AC: 4-5)
  - [ ] Add buttons to Timeline block, open form for edit, confirm for delete.

## Dev Notes
Reuse RoutineForm for edit.
Optimistic updates optional for UX.

### Testing
Unit for API; integration for UI actions.
